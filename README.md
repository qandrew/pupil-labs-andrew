Andrew's pupil labs folder

###Contents

The **sphere_fitter** (formerly singleeyefitterpython) folder contains the .py programs that I am writing. I am porting the code written in c++ from [this Cambridge University paper](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/eyemodelfit/) to python, and keeping the parts that could be applied to Pupil Labs' software. Folder created June 24th, 2015.

The **camera_calibration** folder contains python files using OpenCV to find the camera intrinsics to help undistort the camera image. Files made by Michael Barz. Folder created July 2nd, 2015.

The **visualization** folder contains the python files that visualizes the sphere fitter model. I use openGL to display the sphere and the projected ellipses in a gui window. Folder created July 6th, 2015.
