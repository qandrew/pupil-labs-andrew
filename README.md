Andrew's pupil labs folder

###Contents

The **singleeyefitterpython** folder contains the .py programs that I am writing. I am porting the code written in c++ from [this Cambridge University paper](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/eyemodelfit/) to python, and keeping the parts that could be applied to Pupil Labs' software. Created June 24th, 2015.

The **camera_calibration** folder contains the .py contains python files using OpenCV to find the camera intrinsics to help undistort the camera image. Files made by Michael Barz. Created July 2nd, 2015.
